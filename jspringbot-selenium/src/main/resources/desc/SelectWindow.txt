Selects the window found with locator as the context of actions.

If the window is found, all subsequent commands use that window, until this keyword is used again. If the window is not found, this keyword fails.

locator may be either the title of the window or the name of the window in the JavaScript code that creates it. If multiple windows with same identifier are found, the first one is selected.

Special locator main (default) can be used to select the main window.

Example:
| Click Link | popup_link | don't wait | # opens new window |
| Select Window | popupName | | |
| Title Should Be | Popup Title | | |
| Select Window | | | # Chooses the main window again |

NOTE: Selecting windows opened by links with target _blank does not seem to work on Internet Explorer.
